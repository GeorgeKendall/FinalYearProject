# FinalYearProject 
Django application for content-based recommendation


UNDERGRAD PROJECT FOR BSci Computer Science

Title: 'Content-based film recommendation built with textual user reviews and its comparison to modern approachesâ€™
===========================================

Inside is contained the files needed to run my final year project - please note this is a Django application
and as such creating a blank django app and merging is essential to run this.

ALSO - the ddump_soup.csv file is compressed in /data as the filesize was too large for github, please extract
before use.

Install all libraries necessary from requirements.txt

:)
